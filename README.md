# Joystick Servo and Stepper Controls

This is a joystick interface to servos and steppers.  Basically a pluggable
controller for the Pololu Micro Maestro 6-channel servo controller, which
I use for a small servo-actuated 6DOF arm, and the Peter Norberg Consulting 
SD6DX stepper motor controller, which I use for an old American Robot 
MR5200 6DOF arm.  In each case the respective controller has to be set up
appropriately, and the specifics of how the joystick engages the control
depends on the controller.
